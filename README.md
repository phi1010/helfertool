##KIF-Helfertool
This is a tool to organize and coordinate shifts, places and assistants for
small to medium events.

It was originally written for the German biannual computer science students
meetup (KIF 41.5) where around 200 people had to be coordinated for 24 hours for 
several days. Its focus is on clarity and being easy-to-use for the helpers as
all those people were unpaid volunteers. We wanted to make their life as easy as
possible and simultaneously reduce the probability of someone forgetting his/her
shift.

##A word of caution
This tool was originally made in a hurry by several people in only a few days. 
Even though we had security in mind, it is not unlikely to have security issues.
For now it's probably a good idea to use it in a trusted environment until a 
good portion of additional development has been done.
So be aware that this software might kill your cat or you goldfish or whatever.
